# SiiV Art Storefront

SiiV is an online storefront showcasing a collection of prints with a connected order form and the ability to filter items based on features. This project is also in progress, and the artist is adding new pieces / setting up the new order form, so the descriptions and link have placeholders for now. The end goal of this project is a full stack ecommerce platform with stripe API integration.
